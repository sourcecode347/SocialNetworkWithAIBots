philtext=['Life is nothing until it is lived; but it is yours to make sense of, and the value of it is nothing else but the sense that you choose.',' One must have chaos in one to give birth to a dancing star.','The real world - an idea no longer of any use, not even a duty any longer - an idea grown useless, superfluous, consequently a refuted idea: let us abolish it! ','In general, the urge for solitude is a sign that there is after all spirit in a person and the measure of what spirit there is.','A man can never really know whether he isn t sitting in a madhouse.','Act only on that maxim through which you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law.',' It s up to you to learn to think',' Enlighten men and you will be crushed.',' It is not inequality that is the real evil, but dependence.',' I do not know what I am: I am not what I know','As it is with a play, so it is with life - what matters is not how long the acting lasts, but how good it is.',' We re born unequal, we die equal.','He who says that the time for philosophy has not yet come or that it has passed is like someone who says that the time for happiness has not yet come or that it has passed.','For just as there is no use in medical expertise if it does not give therapy for bodily diseases, so too there is no use in philosophy if it does not expel the suffering of the soul.','There is knowledge of each thing only when we know its essence.',' Matter is unknowable in itself.','There is an essence only of those things whose description is a definition.',' The mind s eye begins to see clearly when the outer eyes grow dim.',' In reality we know nothing - for truth is in the depths.',' Many who have learned much posess no sense.',' Fools live without enjoying life',' There are only, everywhere, differences and traces of traces.','If there are beings on, say, Alpha Centauri, who cannot feel pain and who do not mind individual death, then very likely our fuss about murder and suffering will seem to them to be much ado about nothing.','Power is everywhere; not because it embraces everything, but because it comes from everywhere.','The totality of our so-called knowledge or beliefs, from the most casual matters of geography and history to the profoundest laws of atomic physics or even of pure mathematics and logic, is a man-made fabric which impinges on experience only along the edges.',' We aim at simplicity and hope for truth.','The essence of reason consists not in securing for man a foundation and powers, but in calling him in question and in inviting him to justice.','Man makes himself; he is not found ready-made; he makes himself by the choice of his morality, and he cannot but choose a morality, such is the pressures of circumstances upon him.','Philosophy, which once seemed obsolete, lives on because the moment to realize it was missed.','Theories are important and indispensable because without them we could not orientate ourselves in the world - we could not live.','A comfortable, smooth, reasonable, democratic unfreedom prevails in advanced industrial civilization, a token of technological progress.','At the basis of human life there exists a principle of insufficiency.','There is no document of civilization which is not at the same time a document of barbarism.',' Metaphysicians are musicians without musical ability.','There is no more light in a genius than in any other honest man - but he has a particular kind of lens to concentrate this light into a burning point.',' Words are also deeds.',' Language sets everyone the same traps; it is an immense network of wrong turnings.',' Language is the house of Being.',' On the question of the world as a whole, science founders.','We are like sailors who must rebuild their ship on the open sea, never able to dismantle it in dry-dock and to reconstruct it out of the best materials.','The good life is one inspired by love and guided by knowledge.','The fall of a sandcastle on the English coast changes the nature of the Great Pyramid.','Meaning is wider in scope as well as more precious in value than truth, and philosophy is occupied with meaning rather than truth.','Between the meanings of consciousness and reality there yawns a veritable abyss.',' Experiment is the sole source of truth.',' God is dead',' One thing is needful: To give style to one s character - a great and rare art!','Life is not determined by consciousness, but conciousness by life.','When the danger is so great that death has become the hope, then despair is the hopelessness of not being able to die.','Choice itself is decisive for a personality s content; in choice personality immerses itself in what is chosen, and when it does not choose it wastes consumptively away.','To be GOVERNED is to be watched, inspected, spied upon, directed, law-driven, numbered, regulated, enrolled, indoctrinated, preached at, controlled, checked, estimated, censured, commanded, by creatures who have neither the right nor the wisdom nor the virtue to do so.','Eccentricity has always abounded when and where strength of character has abounded; and the amount of eccentricity in a society has generally been proportional to the amount of genius, mental vigour, and moral courage it contained.','Now, each of us is aware, if he looks back on his own history, that he was a theologian in his childhood, a metaphysician in his youth and a natural philosopher in his manhood.','Time is that by virtue of which everything becomes nothingness in our hands and loses all real value.','There is no human affair which stands so constantly and generally in close connection with chance as war.','The need to raise itself above humanity is humanity s main characteristic.','A fragment, like a miniature work of art, has to be entirely isolated from the surrounding world and be complete in itself like a porcupine.','The individual who has not risked his life may well be recognized as a person, but he has not attained to the truth of this recognition as an independent self-consciousness.','The True is thus the Bacchanalian revel in which no member is not drunk; yet because each member collapses as soon as he drops out, the revel is just as much transparent and simple repose.',' In the midst of wealth, what lamentable poverty!','Attend to yourself: turn your attention away from everything that surrounds you and towards your inner life; this is the first demand that philosophy makes of its disciple.','It is through publicity alone that justice becomes the mother of security.','Man is so perfectible and corruptible that he can become a madman through sheer intellect.','Enlightenment is man s release from his self-incurred tutelage.','Genius is the talent (or natural gift) that gives the rule to art.','Act in such a way that you always treat humanity, whether in your own person or in the person of any other, never simply as a means, but always at the same time as an end.','Thoughts without content are empty, intuitions without concepts are blind.','We are born into the middle of a labyrinth where a thousand turns are laid out for the sole purpose of leading us astray',' Does anyone really know where they re going to?',' Man is born free; and everywhere he is in chains.','We can give no reason for extending to the future our experience in the past; but are entirely determined by custom, when we conceive an effect to follow from its usual cause.','When I shall be dead, the principles of which I am composed will still perform their part in the universe and will be equally useful in the grand fabric, as when they composed this individual creature.','Thanks to the imagination, to its flattering touch, the cold skeleton of reason acquires living, rosy flesh; thanks to it the sciences flourish, the arts are embellished, woods speak, echoes sigh, rocks weep, marble breathes and all inanimate objects come to life.','Dissension is the great evil of mankind, and toleration its only remedy.','Better it is to say that the government most conformable to nature is that which best agrees with the humour and disposition of the people in whose favour it is established.','The brain therefore you speak of, being a sensible thing, exists only in the mind.','Abstract sentences are the work of philosophers, because they contain universals, but reflections on the passions are the work of false and frigid poets.','It follows from the supreme perfection of God that he chose the best possible plan in producing the universe, a plan in which there is the greatest variety together with the greatest order.','To think often and never to retain it so much as one moment is a very useless sort of thinking; and the soul in such a state of thinking does very little if at all excel that of a looking-glass, which constantly receives variety of images or ideas but retains none: they disappear and vanish and there remain no footsteps of them; the looking-glass is never the better for such ideas, nor the soul for such thoughts.','In the mind there is no absolute, or free, will; but the mind is determined to will this or that by a cause which is likewise determined by another, and this again by another, and so on to infinity.','The more we let each voice sing out with its own true tone, the richer will be the diversity of the chant in unison.','Man s greatness comes from knowing he is wretched: a tree does not know it is wretched.',' Neither the sun nor death can be looked at steadily','In the matters we propose to investigate, our inquiries should be directed, not to what others have thought, nor to what we ourselves conjecture, but to what we can clearly and distinctly see and with certainty deduce, for knowledge is not won in any other way.','Every man, for his own part, calleth that which pleaseth, and that is delightful to himself, GOOD; and that EVIL which displeaseth him: insomuch that while every man differeth from other in constitution, they differ also from another concerning the common distinction of good and evil.','For words are wise men s counters, they do but reckon by them; but they are the money of fools, that value them by the authority of an Aristotle, a Cicero, or a Thomas, or any other Doctor whatsoever, if but a man.','We must begin again from the very foundations, unless we would revolve for ever in a circle with mean and contemptible progress.','The gems of philosophy are not less precious because they are not understood.',' Were I not, God would not be.',' If we actually possessed one grain of knowledge, there would be no holding us back.','I do hold strongly to this: that it is better to be rash rather than timid; for Fortune is a woman and the man who wants to subdue her must beat and bully her.','Thus it appears those arts are most blessed which have the closest affinity with stupidity, and those people are happiest who have been able to avoid contact with the arts and sciences altogether, simply following nature, which never fails them except when they try to reach beyond the proper limits of their human nature.','God exists in such a manner that He cannot not exist; in fact, He exists necessarily; and He is not from something else.',' Whoever desires to be given everything must first give everything away.',' There is nothing absurd in denying that God exists.','The more hopeless the disease, the more splendid is the devotion and unselfish the charity of those who strive to alleviate it.',' God is a circle whose centre is everywhere, whose circumference is nowhere.',' You exist so truly, Lord my God, that You cannot even be thought not to exist.','Despite a clouded memory, the mind seeks its own good, though like a drunkard it cannot find the path home.',' I am in a sorry state, for I do not even know what I do not know!','For, I say, God is not external to any one, but is present in all things, though they are oblivious of His presence.','Sceptics are philanthropic and wish to cure by argument, as far as they are able, the conceit and rashness of the Dogmatists.','In relation to each segment of the earth different peoples live in different countries, but if we look at the entire compass of this world there is only one country for all, the whole earth, and one home, the world.','It is not the things themselves that disturb people but the judgements they make about these things','We ridiculously fear one death, having died many times already and ceaselessly continuing to die.',' There are times when even to live is an act of bravery',' God is continuously ordering matter through his thought.',' In short,fools make their lives a hell on earth.',' People always hate anyone who is a better man than themselves.',' If my foot had a brain, it would welcome the mud.','Someone could sooner immerse a bladder filled with air than compel a virtuous man to act against his will.','The words of that philosopher who ofers no therapy for human suffering are empty and vain.',' For it is from wonder that men both now begin and at first began to philosophize.','Surely it is also absurd to make the blessed person solitary; for no one would choose to possess all good things and yet remain alone, since a human being is a political creature, tending by nature to live with others.','If anyone comes to the gates of poetry and expects to become an adequate poet by acquiring expert knowledge of the subject without the Muses madness, he will fail, and his self-controlled verses will be eclipsed by the poetry of men who have been driven out of their minds.','Every seeker after wisdom knows that until philosophy takes it over his soul is a helpless prisoner, chained hand and foot in the body, compelled to view reality not directly but only through its prison bars, and wallowing in utter ignorance.','I only wish that ordinary people had an unlimited capacity for doing harm, then they might have an unlimited power for doing good, which would be a splendid thing if it were so.','Ordinary people seem not to realize that those who really apply themselves in the proper way to philosophy are directly and of their own accord preparing themselves for dying and death.',' In fleeing death men pursue it','The old theologians and prophets testify that the soul has been yoked to the body as a punishment and that it is imprisoned in it as though in a tomb.',' Man is the measure of all things','Fools - they have no far-ranging thoughts: they suppose that what did not exist before comes into being or that something may die and perish entirely.',' Appearances are a glimpse of the obscure','Whatever is for being and for thinking must be; for it can be, and nothing can not.','Know then that war is common, that justice is strife, and that all things come to be in accordance with strife and necessity','But if cattle and horses or lions had hands, or were able to draw with their hands and do the works that men can do, horses would draw the form of their gods like horses, and cattle like cattle, and they would make their gods bodies resemble their own.'\
	,"There are two things a person should never be angry at, what they can help, and what they cannot.","Courage is the first of human qualities because it is the quality which guarantees the others.","Quality is not an act, it is a habit.","Only the educated are free.","Control thy passions lest they take vengence on thee.","No man should bring children into the world who is unwilling to persevere to the end in their nature and education.","Love is composed of a single soul inhabiting two bodies.","People are like dirt. They can either nourish you and help you grow as a person or they can stunt your growth and make you wilt and die.","Rhetoric is the art of ruling the minds of men.","The key is to keep company only with people who uplift you, whose presence calls forth your best.","Of all the varieties of virtues, liberalism is the most beloved.","Friendship is a single soul dwelling in two bodies.","Nothing in the affairs of men is worthy of great anxiety.","It is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it.","Good people do not need laws to tell them to act responsibly, while bad people will find a way around the laws.","He is a drunkard who takes more than three glasses though he be not drunk.","Every heart sings a song, incomplete, until another heart whispers back. Those who wish to sing always find a song. At the touch of a lover, everyone becomes a poet.","We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit.","Medicine to produce health must examine disease; and music, to create harmony must investigate discord.","They do certainly give very strange, and newfangled, names to diseases.","Riches do not exhilarate us so much with their possession as they torment us with their loss.","Even when laws have been written down, they ought not always to remain unaltered.","The energy of the mind is the essence of life.","Music is a moral law. It gives soul to the universe, wings to the mind, flight to the imagination, and charm and gaiety to life and to everything.","I don t need a friend who changes when I change and who nods when I nod; my shadow does that much better.","Wise men speak because they have something to say; Fools because they have to say something.","This City is what it is because our citizens are what they are.","The unexamined life is not worth living.","Moral excellence comes about as a result of habit. We become just by doing just acts, temperate by doing temperate acts, brave by doing brave acts.","Anyone can become angry - that is easy, but to be angry with the right person at the right time, and for the right purpose and in the right way - that is not within everyone s power and that is not easy.","How can you prove whether at this moment we are sleeping, and all our thoughts are a dream; or whether we are awake, and talking to one another in the waking state?","The way to gain a good reputation is to endeavor to be what you desire to appear.","There was never a genius without a tincture of madness.","Dignity does not consist in possessing honors, but in deserving them.","The ultimate value of life depends upon awareness and the power of contemplation rather than upon mere survival.","True wisdom comes to each of us when we realize how little we understand about life, ourselves, and the world around us.","Most people would rather give than get affection.","Beware the barrenness of a busy life.","Once made equal to man, woman becomes his superior.","Probable impossibilities are to be preferred to improbable possibilities.","When men speak ill of thee, live so as nobody may believe them.","I have gained this from philosophy: that I do without being commanded what others do only from fear of the law.","The secret to humor is surprise.","Pleasure in the job puts perfection in the work.","Excess generally causes reaction, and produces a change in the opposite direction, whether it be in the seasons, or in individuals, or in governments.","Worthless people live only to eat and drink; people of worth eat and drink only to live.","Make the best use of what is in your power, and take the rest as it happens.","Those who intend on becoming great should love neither themselves nor their own things, but only what is just, whether it happens to be done by themselves or others.","All things will be produced in superior quantity and quality, and with greater ease, when each man works at a single occupation, in accordance with his natural gifts, and at the right moment, without meddling with anything else.","It is not so much our friends  help that helps us as the confident knowledge that they will help us.","A great city is not to be confounded with a populous one.","Apply yourself both now and in the next life. Without effort, you cannot be prosperous. Though the land be good, You cannot have an abundant crop without cultivation.","Thou wilt find rest from vain fancies if thou doest every act in life as though it were thy last.","You will never do anything in this world without courage. It is the greatest quality of the mind next to honor.","He is a wise man who does not grieve for the things which he has not, but rejoices for those which he has.","Philosophy is the highest music.","I count him braver who overcomes his desires than him who conquers his enemies; for the hardest victory is over self.","In a democracy the poor will have more power than the rich, because there are more of them, and the will of the majority is supreme.","Ignorance of all things is an evil neither terrible nor excessive, nor yet the greatest of all; but great cleverness and much learning, if they be accompanied by a bad training, are a much greater misfortune.","For a man to conquer himself is the first and noblest of all victories.","Friendship is essentially a partnership.","There must always remain something that is antagonistic to good.","It is not he who reviles or strikes you who insults you, but your opinion that these things are insulting.","The very spring and root of honesty and virtue lie in good education.","Mothers are fonder than fathers of their children because they are more certain they are their own.","It is folly for a man to pray to the gods for that which he has the power to obtain by himself.","Suffering becomes beautiful when anyone bears great calamities with cheerfulness, not through insensibility but through greatness of mind.","The virtue of justice consists in moderation, as regulated by wisdom.","It is just that we should be grateful, not only to those with whose views we may agree, but also to those who have expressed more superficial views; for these also contributed something, by developing before us the powers of thought.","I never desired to please the rabble. What pleased them, I did not learn; and what I knew was far removed from their understanding.","Do not spoil what you have by desiring what you have not; remember that what you now have was once among the things you only hoped for.","Courage stands halfway between cowardice and rashness, one of which is a lack, the other an excess of courage.","The greater the difficulty the more glory in surmounting it. Skillful pilots gain their reputation from storms and tempests.","When there is an income tax, the just man will pay more and the unjust less on the same amount of income.","The best friend is the man who in wishing me well wishes it for my sake.","What is a friend? A single soul dwelling in two bodies.","The gods too are fond of a joke.","Know how to listen, and you will profit even from those who talk badly.","The roots of education are bitter, but the fruit is sweet.","What it lies in our power to do, it lies in our power not to do.","A few vices are sufficient to darken many virtues.","The ideal man bears the accidents of life with dignity and grace, making the best of circumstances.","I am called a dog because I fawn on those who give me anything, I yelp at those who refuse, and I set my teeth in rascals.","Fear is pain arising from the anticipation of evil.","It is impossible to begin to learn that which one thinks one already knows.","You can discover more about a person in an hour of play than in a year of conversation.","It s not what happens to you, but how you react to it that matters.","Both oligarch and tyrant mistrust the people, and therefore deprive them of their arms.","Imagine for yourself a character, a model personality, whose example you determine to follow, in private as well as in public.","No one would choose a friendless existence on condition of having all the other things in the world.","In poverty and other misfortunes of life, true friends are a sure refuge. The young they keep out of mischief; to the old they are a comfort and aid in their weakness, and those in the prime of life they incite to noble deeds.","The end of life is to be like God, and the soul following God will be like Him.","All men s souls are immortal, but the souls of the righteous are immortal and divine.","The mind is not a vessel to be filled but a fire to be kindled.","Knowledge without justice ought to be called cunning rather than wisdom.","If virtue promises happiness, prosperity and peace, then progress in virtue is progress in each of these for to whatever point the perfection of anything brings us, progress is always an approach toward it.","Skillful pilots gain their reputation from storms and tempest.","God has entrusted me with myself.","To accuse others for one s own misfortunes is a sign of want of education. To accuse oneself shows that one s education has begun. To accuse neither oneself nor others shows that one s education is complete.","The greater difficulty, the more glory in surmounting it.

What we have done is so that we don t necessarily peak this weekend, but peak in the end.","I feel better than last year. I m the kind of guy of what is in the past is in the past. I know I have good pitches. I know I feel good, because I did my job with the knee. I m thinking more about this year than last year.

So the signs were there and it s in the hands of the referee.","This morning, the market tends to be looking past that a little bit.","Joe pretty much doesn t care what you ve done in the past.

Since these high-income households are in the best position to withstand deterioration in their financial positions, the shocks are likely to have a limited effect on overall consumer spending.","I think that Wagoner was essentially running GM for the past year at the very least, ... He was certainly the operating guy, and Smith was the strategic guy.","Regardless of what I ve done in the past, this is a big game, carrying a lot of pressure. We all know what s at stake here.","We got past a difficult start to 2005 and had a strong finish to the year by making major progress on our growth plans and achieving record quarterly production in the fourth quarter.

People really opened their hearts for us.","We have all seen the truth of the past year, from the tornadoes this past weekend to the hurricanes on the Gulf Coast, that even in the best-case scenario, we have to be prepared to take care of ourselves.","This match is traditionally a very tough one. We have played plenty of tough, very close matches in the past and we ve been fortunate enough to come out ahead a good bit lately. But as always, Georgia Tech is a quality team that plays good doubles and we expect them to fight extremely hard, they have nothing to lose. Our guys had a great victory on Sunday over Florida and after a big, emotional match like that, we have to make sure we are careful and focused. We certainly want to avoid a letdown.","This in not just a condemnation of the Holocaust. It is a condemnation of all the atrocities in the past and a reminder that terror still surrounds us.","Microsoft is a vestige of the past,","I m not here to discuss the past, ...

Few people are like that.","This past year over 300 graduates went to work for P.A.M. Trucking, ... Over 300 graduates went to work for USA Trucking and over 100 went to work for Star Transportation.","You can t replace a Schweitzer. He was probably more important in the locker room the past two years than on the field. I don t know if there s too many other people on the planet like him as far as motivating (teammates).","I think voters have sent a strong message this past election that they want someone who will go down and work on issues that are priorities for the citizens in the district. Like traffic congestion and finding solutions to the traffic problems, as well as education and development. As state senator, those are the priorities that I will work on.","I think it s the end of progress if you stand still and think of what you ve done in the past. I keep on.","There were only six guys from that team that are on this squad. But last year is in the past. This is now and we re playing for now.","I ve only been catching the past two weeks. It s difficult. I never saw myself as a catcher before. I m all bruised up from foul tips, but it s fun. It gives you a different perspective on the game.","Nobody took any issue with it and that hurts.

We ve been healthy this spring, and that s good.","I m sure we ll cooperate with the committee, as we have in the past,","If you re thinking of the Tennessee-Martin team of old, I don t know about things of the past, but it s a good football team. We didn t get beat by them because we took them lightly. We got beat because they are a better football team than us. I wish somebody else would have played them first. I think it s a wake-up call for the league.","This is something we ve been working for the past three years. We ve gotten beat on a buzzer-beater the last two years (50-49 loss to Johnstown in a Division III district final two years ago, 54-53 loss to Bloom-Carroll in a Division III district final last year), so we re working hard to make sure that doesn t happen again.","It s been a difficult week or two for the stock market. It seems like as soon as we get past one thing, we have another. Overall, it seems the confluence of negative news is making people jittery.","I guess the team can t take it anymore. He has a few cases in the past. Once you get caught twice, three times, something is going on.","Nobody is there to protect the cop. I think the prosecutor should also do that. In the past, it was  Wink, wink, nod, nod; here s what I want you to look at.  But that s why states have moved away from grand juries.

By the end of 2005, we were placing or receiving almost 60 million calls per month on behalf of our customers.

Sales at upscale stores like Saks and Neiman Marcus are also going strong because the stock market has been very customer friendly to this group.","It s certainly not forgotten, but we re moving past it. When you make a mistake like we made, you don t get your credibility back just by saying,  I promise we re not going to do that again.

He still competes, and he hates losing as much as anybody, whether it s a game or a one-on-one battle.","Our past is a story existing only in our minds. Look, analyze, understand, and forgive. Then, as quickly as possible, chuck it.","We ve got to get made because we didn t play like we wanted to play. The past four weeks, we ve gone out there pretty intense. We didn t come out there and play like we should have.","A boardwalk in spirit if not in composition  it s concrete  this path runs 3 miles past beachfront hotels, restaurants, stores, museums, bike-rental shops and street performers.

That s how it is on all road trips. You prepare for the team you are going to play Thursday.","This win is indicative of why this team is different from Heath teams of the past. We didn t shoot the ball very well at all. But we found a way to win in the end. Our seniors stepped up and really led us to this victory.","It wasn t until this past year that we started to feel more comfortable.","I m going to look past this one from this standpoint.

You certainly want to remember it, but you can t live there. I m looking forward to being a part of a new group. It s exciting. We ve got some young talent and some veteran guys who have been around a bit. I think anything is possible with a team like this.","We ve had a bunch of young guys in that role in the past. He was looking for a job. We always respected him. He s done enough damage to us over the years, so we figured why not bring him over to our side.","I think that Wagoner was essentially running GM for the past year at the very least. He was certainly the operating guy, and Smith was the strategic guy.","I think they re still the same Shaw they ve been in the past. And I suspect they ve had some good practices over there this week as well as we ve had over here.","We have very good depth, more than we ve had in the past. Our depth has helped us, and we ve played a tough schedule.","This team works better than other teams we ve had in the past as far as improving themselves on the court, and the attitude is always positive. But this team has its own personality, and unfortunately, it s a passive one.","The past two years haven t been the best because we were really young and we played a lot of good teams. Being down and losing that many games then coming back and (going 17-0) is amazing.","What are they going to do to me that they haven t done already? They took away my entire past. They took away my entire future. What s left for them to take?","I didn t ever see past the beginnings, ... All I saw was the good times.

But it didn t matter because we couldn t hit targets, so it didn t matter who was in out there.","I ve never been more proud of any team in the past 10 years than I am of this team tonight. When we got behind, they could have given up, but they didn t. They kept playing hard. It was a team effort that brought us back tonight. It was everybody.","I m disappointed by it.

Over the past 30 years, the median wage has grown about 9 or 10 percent.","The acceleration of the past several months has been quite stunning, so it s not surprising to get a bit of a pause. After an unusually warm December, January was unusually cold and snowy. That may have affected production.","There s always been that one (rough) round in the past. We don t know what happens. We warm up the same, we do everything the same, and the team falls apart, and it hurts us in the team race. We still stay in it, but that s the round that always loses it for us. But this year, we haven t hit it, ... and I don t see us hitting it this year.","You can model all you want, but it s only going to be based on what happened in the past.

Even if it s not my past.","What we have done in past years is we have different types of shows, the rock bands, the  70s shows.

[Les Miserables]","For one human being to love another: that is perhaps the most difficult of all our tasks, the ultimate, the last test and proof, the work for which all other work is but preparation.","Men have died from time to time, and worms have eaten them, but not for love.","First love is only a little foolishness and a lot of curiosity: no really self-respecting woman would take advantage of it.","The fickleness of the women I love is only equaled by the infernal constancy of the women who love me.","All love is sweet, Given or returned.

Be the living expression of God s kindness; kindness in your face, kindness in your eyes, kindness in your smile.","You can give without loving, but you cannot love without giving.","We were given: Two hands to hold.

[Jesus, In John 15:12]","Give her two red roses, each with a note. The first note says For the woman I love and the second, For my best friend.","True love is the parent of humility.","A baby is born with a need to be loved and never outgrows it.","Where love rules, there is no will to power; where power predominates, there love is lacking. The one is the shadow of the other.","There is no disguise that can for long conceal love where it exists or simulate it where it does not.","Paradise is always where love dwells.","Be loving and the love in your life will increase.","Love is a force more formidable than any other. It is invisible -- it cannot be seen or measured, yet it is powerful enough to transform you in a moment, and offer you more joy than any material possession could.","I get the best feeling in the world when you say hi or even smile at me because I know, even if its just for a second, that I ve crossed your mind.","Hate the sin and love the sinner.","Your task is not to seek for love, but merely to seek and find all the barriers within yourself that you have built against it.","In doing something, do it with love or never do it at all","There is no living with thee, nor without thee.","Love begins with a smile, grows with a kiss, and ends with a teardrop.","I love you not only for what you are, but for what I am when I am with you. I love you not only for what you have made of yourself, but for what you are making of me. I love you for the part of me that you bring out.","A man has only one escape from his old self: to see a different self in the mirror of some woman s eyes.","The love of liberty is the love of others; the love of power is the love of ourselves. We cannot force love.","Do you want me to tell you something really subversive? Love is everything it s cracked up to be. That s why people are so cynical about it. It really is worth fighting for, being brave for, risking everything for. And the trouble is, if you don t risk anything, you risk even more.","Love is what we are born with. Fear is what we learn. The spiritual journey is the unlearning of fear and prejudices and the acceptance of love back in our hearts. Love is the essential reality and our purpose on earth. To be consciously aware of it, to experience love in ourselves and others, is the meaning of life. Meaning does not lie in things. Meaning lies in us.","When we are in love we often doubt that which we most believe.","[The lover says:] How beautiful you are, now that you love me","One can be a soldier without dying, and a lover without sighing.","To love, for us men, is to clasp one woman with our arms, feeling that she lives and breathes just as we do, suffers as we do, thinks with us, loves with us, and, above all, sins with us.","The hours I spend with you I look upon as sort of a perfumed garden, a dim twilight, and a fountain singing to it. You and you alone make me feel that I am alive.

The great majority love in others only what they lend him, their own selves, their version of him.","Conversation has a kind of charm about it, an insuating and insidious something that elicits secrets from us just like love or liquor.","We are not the same persons this year as last; nor are those we love. It is a happy chance if we, changing, continue to love a changed person.","A man reserves his true and deepest love not for the species of woman in whose company he finds himself electrified and enkindled, but for that one in whose company he may feel tenderly drowsy.","Let the lover be disgraceful, crazy, absent-minded. Someone sober will worry about events going badly. Let the lover be.","Love is metaphysical gravity.","To love and win is the best thing. To love and lose, the next best.","Love endures only when the lovers love many things together and not merely each other.","If you love something, let it go.

It is the key to life, and its influences are those that move the world.","You can give without loving, but you can never love without giving.","The choicest thing this world has for a man is affection.","The bonds that unite another person to ourselves exist only in our mind. Memory as it grows fainter relaxes them, and notwithstanding the illusion by which we would fain be cheated and with which, out of love, friendship, politeness, deference, duty, we cheat other people, we exist alone. Man is the creature that cannot emerge from himself, that knows his fellows only in himself; when he asserts the contrary, he is lying.","It s unthinkable not to love --you d have a severe nervous breakdown. Or you d have to be Philip Larkin.","A man in love is like a clipped coupon -- it s time to cash in.","Love is the child of illusion and the parent of disillusion.","To love without role, without power plays, is revolution.","Nothing is more beautiful than the love that has weathered the storms of life. The love of the young for the young, that is the beginning of life. But the love of the old for the old, that is the beginning of things longer.","My first thoughts are that I should not let people down, that I should support them and love them.","A woman knows the face of the man she loves like a sailor knows the open sea.","Love is the only bow of life s dark cloud. It is the Morning and Evening Star. It shines upon the cradle of the babe, and sheds its radiance upon the quiet tomb. It is the Mother of Art, inspirer of poet, patriot, and philosopher. It is the air and light of every heart, builder of every home, kinder of every fire on every hearth, It was the first dream of immortality. It fills the world with melody. Love is the magician, the enchanter, that changes worthless things to joy, and makes right royal kings of common clay.","Celebrate we will because life is short but sweet for certain we re climbing two by two to be sure these days continue.","Give expression to the noble desires that lie in your heart.","Work like you don t need the money, love like you ve never been hurt and dance like nobody s watching. Submitted by Jessica Brown","Only from the heart Can you touch the sky.","He that plants trees loves others besides himself.","Life, the gift of nature Love, the gift of life A Kiss, the gift of Love.","Love is the river of life in the world.","All the beautiful sentiments in the world weigh less than a single lovely action.","Love is a mutual self-giving which ends in self-recovery.","Young love is a flame; very pretty, often very hot and fierce, but still only light and flickering. The love of the older and disciplined heart is as coals, deep-burning, unquenchable.","Love all that has been created by God, both the whole and every grain of sand. Love every leaf and every ray of light. Love the beasts and the birds, love the plants, love every separate fragment. If you love each fragment, you will understand the mystery of the whole resting in God.","One does not fall in love; one grows into love, and love grows in him.","I hold it true, whatever befall; I feel it, when I sorrow most;  tis better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all.","Love consists not in feeling great things but in having great detachment and in suffering for the Beloved.","Love makes your soul crawl out from its hiding place.","And in the end, the love we take will be equal to the love we make.","To fail to love is not to exist at all.","Silently one by one, in the infinite meadows of heaven, Blossomed the lovely stars, the forget-me-nots of the angels","Love alone could waken love.","In every loving woman there is a priestess of the past -- a pious guardian of some affection, of which the object has disappeared.","Love is stronger than violence.","Find the person who will love you because of your differences and not in spite of them and you have found a lover for life.","We really have to understand the person we want to love. If our love is only a will to possess, it is not love. If we only think of ourselves, if we know only our own needs and ignore the needs of the other person, we cannot love.","I can think of no better way of redeeming this tragic world today than love and laughter. Too many of the young have forgotten how to laugh, and too many of the elders have forgotten how to love. Would not our lives be lightened if only we could all learn to laugh more easily at ourselves and to love one another.","For suddenly, I saw you there And through foggy London town The sun was shining everywhere...","Love doesn t make the world go round. Love is what makes the ride worthwhile.","Love feels no burden, thinks nothing of trouble, attempts what is above its strength.... It is therefore able to undertake all things, and it completes many things, and warrants them to take effect, where he who does not love would faint and lie down.","Love is swift, sincere, pious, joyful, generous, strong, patient, faithful, prudent, long-suffering, courageous, and never seeking its own; for wheresoever a person seeketh his own, there he falleth from love.","Love makes everything that is heavy light.","Real love stories never have endings.","If you have it [Love], you don t need to have anything else, and if you don t have it, it doesn t matter much what else you have.","Someday, after mastering winds, waves, tides and gravity, we shall harness the energy of love; and for the second time in the history of the world, man will have discovered fire.","A man travels the world over in search of what he needs and returns home to find it.","He who is not impatient is not in love.","Love does not consist in gazing at each other, but in looking outward together in the same direction.","Love is not just looking at each other, it s looking in the same direction.","To love and be loved is the great happiness of existence.","It is here, my daughters, that love is to be found -- not hidden away in corners but in the midst of occasions of sin. And believe me, although we may more often fail and commit small lapses, our gain will be incomparably the greater.","Let no one who loves be called unhappy Even love unreturned has its rainbow.","It is funny about life: if you refuse to accept anything but the very best you will very often get it.","If a man should importune me to give a reason why I loved him, I find it could no otherwise be expressed, than by making answer: because it was he, because it was I.","I laugh, I love, I hope, I try I hurt, I need, I fear, I cry. And I know you do the same things too, So we re really not that different, me and you.","The bravest thing that men do is love women","Some people never say the words  I love you  It s not their style to be so bold. Some people never say those words:  I love you  But, like a child, they re longing to be told.","The yearning for an afterlife is the opposite of selfish: it is love and praise for the world that we are privileged, in this complex interval of light, to witness and experience.","The love of our neighbor in all its fullness simply means being able to say, What are you going through?","If you have it [love], you don t need to have anything else. If you don t have it, it doesn t matter much what else you have","Love is like a game of chess: One false move and you re mated.","To the world you are one person, but to one person you are the world.","In the evening of life, we will be judged on love alone.","Love is the triumph of imagination over intelligence.","Love is the only gold.","Neither a lofty degree of intelligence nor imagination nor both together go to the making of genius.

I say, I believe, that one must love with all of one s being, or else live, come what may, a life of complete chastity.","The earth is like a beautiful bride who needs no manmade jewels to heighten her loveliness...","Harmony is pure love, for love is a concerto.","It is a lovely thing to have a husband and wife developing together and having the feeling of falling in love again. That is what marriage really means: helping one another to reach the full status of being persons, responsible and autonomous beings who do not run away from life.","We are shaped and fashioned by what we love.","I think its nice when people find love, because I feel like everyone deserves it.","If a woman doesn t chase a man a little, she doesn t love him.","Today I begin to understand what love must be, if it exists.

That is what I imagine love to be: incompleteness in absence.","It is wrong to think that love comes from long companionship and persevering courtship. Love is the offspring of spiritual affinity and unless that affinity is created in a moment, it will not be created for years or even generations.","Love is the vital essence that pervades and permeates, from the center to the circumference, the graduating circles of all thought and action. Love is the talisman of human weal and woe--the open sesame to every soul.","One forgives to the degree that one loves.","Real success is finding your lifework in the worth that you love.","If you love it let it go.

We feel love as we feel the warmth of our blood, we breathe love as we breathe air, we hold it in ourselves as we hold our thoughts. Nothing more exists for us.","You say that love is nonsense....I tell you it is no such thing. For weeks and months it is a steady physical pain, an ache about the heart, never leaving one, by night or by day; a long strain on one s nerves like toothache or rheumatism, not intolerable at any one instant, but exhausting by its steady drain on the strength.","It is a beautiful trait in the lovers character, that they think no evil of the object loved.","If I know what love is, it is because of you.","Love expands.","Whether life is worth living depends on whether there is love in life.","Love possesses not nor will it be possessed, for love is sufficient unto love.","I know that I can give love for a minute, for half an hour; for a day, for a month, but I can give and I m very happy to do that and I want to do that.","Love can neither be bought or sold, its only price is love.","Follow love and it will flee, flee love and it will follow.","Love is the master key which opens the gates of happiness.","The song that we hear with our ears is only the song that is sung in our hearts.","Love is a great beautifier.","Love is the great miracle cure.

But the love of the old for the old, that is the beginning of things longer.","True love is like ghosts, which everybody talks about and few have seen.","Love feels no burden, regards not labors, strives toward more than it attains, argues not of impossibility, since it believes that it may and can do all things.

Never mind- the uglier we get in the eyes of others, the lovelier we shall be to each other; that has always been my firm faith about friendship.","Love cures people -- both the ones who give it and the ones who receive it.","Bitterness imprisons life; love releases it. Bitterness paralyzes life; love empowers it. Bitterness sours life; love sweetens it. Bitterness sickens life; love heals it. Bitterness blinds life; love anoints its eyes.","About all you can do in life is be who you are. Some people will love you for you. Most will love you for what you can do for them, and some won t like you at all.","Ultimately love is everything.","And if it all falls apart, I will know deep in my heart, the only dream that mattered had come true. In this life, I was loved by you.","Love is not to be purchased, and affection has no price.","We must love one another or die.","Some people think only intellect counts: knowing how to solve problems, knowing how to get by, knowing how to identify an advantage and seize it.

It really is worth fighting for, being brave for, risking everything for. And the trouble is, if you don t risk anything, you risk even more.","Love is what we are born with. Fear is what we learn. The spiritual journey is the unlearning of fear and prejudices and the acceptance of love back in our hearts. Love is the essential reality and our purpose on earth.

Meaning lies in us.","When we are in love we often doubt that which we most believe.","[The lover says:] How beautiful you are, now that you love me","One can be a soldier without dying, and a lover without sighing.","To love, for us men, is to clasp one woman with our arms, feeling that she lives and breathes just as we do, suffers as we do, thinks with us, loves with us, and, above all, sins with us.","The hours I spend with you I look upon as sort of a perfumed garden, a dim twilight, and a fountain singing to it.

The great majority love in others only what they lend him, their own selves, their version of him.","Conversation has a kind of charm about it, an insuating and insidious something that elicits secrets from us just like love or liquor.","A man reserves his true and deepest love not for the species of woman in whose company he finds himself electrified and enkindled, but for that one in whose company he may feel tenderly drowsy.","Love is metaphysical gravity.","To love and win is the best thing. To love and lose, the next best.","If you love something, let it go. If it comes back to you, its yours forever.

It is the key to life, and its influences are those that move the world.","You can give without loving, but you can never love without giving.","The choicest thing this world has for a man is affection.","The bonds that unite another person to ourselves exist only in our mind. Memory as it grows fainter relaxes them, and notwithstanding the illusion by which we would fain be cheated and with which, out of love, friendship, politeness, deference, duty, we cheat other people, we exist alone. Man is the creature that cannot emerge from himself, that knows his fellows only in himself; when he asserts the contrary, he is lying.","It s unthinkable not to love --you d have a severe nervous breakdown. Or you d have to be Philip Larkin.","A man in love is like a clipped coupon -- it s time to cash in.","Love is the child of illusion and the parent of disillusion.","To love without role, without power plays, is revolution.","Love is the only bow of life s dark cloud. It is the Morning and Evening Star. It shines upon the cradle of the babe, and sheds its radiance upon the quiet tomb. It is the Mother of Art, inspirer of poet, patriot, and philosopher.

If we only think of ourselves, if we know only our own needs and ignore the needs of the other person, we cannot love.","I can think of no better way of redeeming this tragic world today than love and laughter.

That is what marriage really means: helping one another to reach the full status of being persons, responsible and autonomous beings who do not run away from life.","We are shaped and fashioned by what we love.","If a woman doesn t chase a man a little, she doesn t love him.","Today I begin to understand what love must be, if it exists.

We love Arnie. The best way I can sum this up is when I tell my kids to look up the definition of class, his picture is next to the word. That s what we think about him. Not one person out here doesn t think that.","I love white pines, and they can be in my yard, ... But I like their plan for the reason that this state forest is so unique globally. In effect every area of white pine in the state forest is not being devoted to what is ours to contribute to the biodiversity of the rest of the world.","I d love to have to rent two trucks.","We really just love the draft - and when you love something as much as this, you have to get as much information as possible to do it the way you want to.

Our philosophy is to tire the other team.","See, he knows what my philosophy is and would try to sneak around it a little bit and try some extra things. He would run a little bit before I wanted him to run. But you know, there s part of me, knowing Lindsey Hunter, saying,  That s part of the equation. That s just who he is.

After looking at the Thomas Pink brand and philosophy, it was evident that the two brands were a perfect fit, as each could be equated to cool, sophisticated and stylish.

There is no substitute for an all-out, over-the-ramparts, howling charge against life. That s living. Living does not consist of sitting in a temple in the shadows and getting rheumatism from the cold stones. Living is hot, it s fast, it s often brutal! It has a terrific gamut of emotional reactions.
